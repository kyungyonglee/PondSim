 /**
  * This abstract class is used to model networks which have
  * growing graphs.
  *
  * The general rule is the following:
  * At each time step, a new node is created and added to
  * the network.  The node is then connected to some number
  * of nodes @see SimpleRuleNet::getConnectionCount.
  * 
  * Then a set of nodes are selected to remove (@see
  * SimpleRuleNet::getRemoveNodes).  If the average of that
  * function is note less than 1, the network will not be
  * growing in size.
  *
  * Then for each of the above nodes, check to see if the
  * their deleted edges will need compensation (@see
  * SimpleRuleNet::needsCompensation).
  *
  * The function that describes the above general algorithm
  * is SimpleRuleNet::incrementTime.  That function IS NOT
  * VIRTUAL.  All subclasses share the same above approach.
  * The only changes in the algorithm are made to how the
  * various selection functions are implemented.
